## EASD: Explainable Sequential Anomaly Detection via Prototypes

We propose **EASD**, a prototype-based framework for explainable sequential anomaly detection. By linking anomalous subsequences to representative prototypes, EASD provides human-understandable explanations while maintaining strong detection accuracy. Experiments on benchmark log datasets confirm that prototype-based explanations improve interpretability without degrading performance.
