abstract: |
  We propose **GLEAD**, a framework for sequential anomaly detection that provides both local explanations (highlighting anomalous subsequences) and global explanations (dataset-wide patterns). This dual perspective improves transparency for practitioners while maintaining strong detection performance.

summary: "Sequential anomaly detection with local and global explanations."
