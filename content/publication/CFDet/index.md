abstract: |
  We propose **CFDet**, a counterfactual explanation framework for sequence anomaly detection. CFDet identifies anomalous entries by generating minimal and plausible modifications that alter a modelâ€™s prediction from anomalous to normal. Experiments on BGL, Thunderbird, and CERT datasets demonstrate that CFDet produces high-fidelity explanations and consistently outperforms attention-based, Shapley value, and gradient-based baselines.

summary: "Counterfactual explanations for sequence anomaly detection, providing interpretable insights."
