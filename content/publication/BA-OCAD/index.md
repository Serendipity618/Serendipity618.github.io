abstract: |
  We propose **BA-OCAD**, a clean-label backdoor attack framework targeting one-class sequential anomaly detection models. By injecting stealthy triggers into training data, BA-OCAD enables adversaries to mislead anomaly detectors at inference while maintaining benign performance.

summary: "Clean-label backdoor attack against one-class sequential anomaly detection models."
