  We propose **EASD**, a prototype-based framework for explainable sequential anomaly detection. By linking anomalous subsequences to representative prototypes, EASD provides human-understandable explanations while maintaining strong detection accuracy.

summary: "Prototype-based explainable sequential anomaly detection."
