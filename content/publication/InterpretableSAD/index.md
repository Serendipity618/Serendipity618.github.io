abstract: |
  We propose **InterpretableSAD**, a framework for anomaly detection in sequential log data with built-in interpretability. The model detects abnormal subsequences while providing explanations through interpretable prototypes. Experiments on system log datasets demonstrate that InterpretableSAD achieves competitive detection accuracy while offering human-understandable explanations.

summary: "Prototype-based framework for interpretable anomaly detection in sequential log data."
