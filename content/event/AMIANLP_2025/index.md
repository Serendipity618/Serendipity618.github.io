summary: "Lightning talk at AMIA 2025 NLP Workshop on scalable knowledge graph retrieval, from single-graph incidence methods to partitioned multi-graph approaches for biomedical reasoning."
abstract: "This lightning talk introduces LogosKG, a framework for efficient and scalable multi-hop knowledge graph retrieval. The approach leverages sparse incidence factorizations for single-graph retrieval and extends to partitioned multi-graph designs with degree-aware routing, caching, and distributed execution. Applications in large-scale biomedical reasoning and LLM integration are discussed."
